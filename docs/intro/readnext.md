# What to read next

So you’ve read all the introductory material and have decided you’d like to keep
using Krustlet to run your WebAssembly applications. We’ve only just scratched
the surface.

So what’s next?

Well, we’ve always been big fans of learning by doing. At this point you should
know enough to start a project of your own and start fooling around. As you need
to learn new tricks, come back to the documentation.

We’ve put a lot of effort into making Krustlet's documentation useful, easy to
read and as complete as possible. The rest of this document explains more about
how the documentation works so that you can get the most out of it.

(Yes, this is documentation about documentation. Rest assured we have no plans
to write a document about how to read the document about documentation.)

## How the documentation is organized

Krustlet's main documentation is broken up into “chunks” designed to fill
different needs:

The [introductory material][intro] is designed for people new to Krustlet – or
to WebAssembly on Kubernetes in general. It doesn’t cover anything in depth, but
instead gives a high-level overview of how running apps on Kubernetes“feels”.

The [topic guides][topics], on the other hand, dive deep into individual parts
of Krustlet. There are complete guides to the internals of Krustlet's
architecture. This is probably where you’ll want to spend most of your time; if
you work your way through these guides you should come out knowing pretty much
everything there is to know about Krustlet.
